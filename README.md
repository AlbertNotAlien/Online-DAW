- Used Web-Audio-API to complete `recording` and `exporting` audio files.
- Utilized Google Cloud SDK for uploading audio files to Firebase Storage while resolving CORS issues.
- Managed drag event of clips and midi notes to `change the position, start-time, length and pitch` by using React-Draggable.
- Managed global states with `Recoil`, including managed project configuration data and individual tracks data.
- Used `immer` to work with immutable nested state, including notes data managed on the piano roll.
- Used Firebase Firestore database to manage data and get `real-time updates` for collaborative editing.
- Linted code by ESLint plugin (eslint-plugin-import).
